## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine to use the recommended `live-server`.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/riteshh-thakur/Canva-Editor.git](https://github.com/riteshh-thakur/Canva-Editor.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Canva-Editor
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command uses `npx` to run a temporary local server. It will automatically open your project in a new browser tab and reload the page whenever you save a file.
    ```sh
    npx live-server
    ```
    Your editor will be available at a local address, typically `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
